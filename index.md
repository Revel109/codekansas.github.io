Hello! You've reached the blog of Ben Bolte. I am a Master's candidate in
Computer Science at Emory University in Atlanta, GA, currently also an intern at
Google. Check out <a href="/resources/misc/wireworld.html"
target="_blank">wireworld</a> and <a href="/resume.html" target="_blank">my
resume</a>.

I'm really interested in problems at the intersection of machine learning and
neuroscience. If you have any such problems that you'd like to collaborate on,
let me know!
