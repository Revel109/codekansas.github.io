There he ended the life of an innocent young girl named Sarah Root (corpus/barack_obama.txt).
She was 21 years old and was killed the day after graduating from college with a 4 (corpus/hillary_clinton.txt).

But to this Administration their amazing daughter was just one more American life that wasn t worth protecting (corpus/hillary_clinton.txt).
One more child to sacrifice on the altar of open borders (corpus/china.txt).

Not only have our citizens endured domestic disaster but they have lived through one international humiliation after another (corpus/barack_obama.txt).
We all remember the images of our sailors being forced to their knees by their Iranian captors at gunpoint (corpus/islam.txt).

Tonight I will share with you my plan of action for America (corpus/barack_obama.txt).
The most important difference between our plan and that of our opponents is that our plan will put America First (corpus/hillary_clinton.txt).
As long as we are led by politicians who will not put America First then we can be assured that other nations will not treat America with respect (corpus/hillary_clinton.txt).
My plan will begin with safety at home which means safe neighborhoods secure borders and protection from terrorism (corpus/barack_obama.txt).
On the economy I will outline reforms to add millions of new jobs and trillions in new wealth that can be used to rebuild America (corpus/china.txt).
A number of these reforms that I will outline tonight will be opposed by some of our nation s most powerful special interests (corpus/china.txt).

Big business elite media and major donors are lining up behind the campaign of my opponent because they know she will keep our rigged system in place (corpus/hillary_clinton.txt).

And when a Secretary of State illegally stores her emails on a private server deletes 33 000 of them so the authorities can t see her crime puts our country at risk lies about it in every different form and faces no consequence I know that corruption has reached a level like never before (corpus/hillary_clinton.txt).
When the FBI Director says that the Secretary of State was extremely careless and negligent in handling our classified secrets I also know that these terms are minor compared to what she actually did (corpus/hillary_clinton.txt).
They were just used to save her from facing justice for her terrible crimes (corpus/hillary_clinton.txt).
In fact her single greatest accomplishment may be committing such an egregious crime and getting away with it especially when others have paid so dearly (corpus/hillary_clinton.txt).
When that same Secretary of State rakes in millions of dollars trading access and favors to special interests and foreign powers I know the time for action has come (corpus/hillary_clinton.txt).

We must have the best intelligence gathering operation in the world (corpus/china.txt).
We must abandon the failed policy of nation building and regime change that Hillary Clinton pushed in Iraq Libya Egypt and Syria (corpus/hillary_clinton.txt).

By ending catch and release on the border we will stop the cycle of human smuggling and violence (corpus/hillary_clinton.txt).
By enforcing the rules for the millions who overstay their visas our laws will finally receive the respect they deserve (corpus/united_states_constitution.txt).

I am going to bring our jobs back to Ohio and to America and I am not going to let companies move to other countries firing their employees along the way without consequences (corpus/hillary_clinton.txt).
