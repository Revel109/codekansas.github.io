  Field guide to traveling to Cuba for spring break as a naive college student.

# Hook

Without infringing on copyrights too much, the introduction to the Havana chapter of the Cuba edition of the Lonely Planet Travel Guide goes a little something like this: "Close your eyes... imagine... Waves crashing against... a young couple... harmonizing... across... the smell of diesel fumes and... Hemingway beards... No one could have invented... the... damned... swashbuckling... seduction." The guide's authors' eloquent prose captures to a tee the exact feeling I got from being there, and in the paragraphs that follow, I hope to convey this feeling to you, the reader. In particular, throughout this post I hope to provide an accurate and complete account of my experience traveling to Havana, Cuba as a plucky, naive college student, in the hopes that other plucky, naive college students will find it helpful and informative.

# Exposition

Back in January, I went to interview for a research lab in upstate New York (which is unbearably, bitingly cold). It was pretty cool, but the major outcome was that I ended up with an $800 travel voucher for Delta Airlines for taking a slightly later flight than the scheduled one. I'd been thinking about going to Cuba since the embargo was (more or less) lifted, and it turned out that two flights between Atlanta and Havana on Delta costed almost exactly $800. It is cool to think about being able to go somewhere that was closed off all through my parents' lifetime. It's probably a bit similar to if my kid were to go to North Korea, if North Korea were sunny, had nice beaches and rum, and all of a sudden decided to market itself to college students on Spring Break.

Fast forward a month and some insightful, reasoned back-and-forth regarding the destination's pros and cons, and the tickets were mine. $400 is a bit expensive for flights from Atlanta to Havana normally, and budget airlines like Spirit can run closer to $150 to $200, presumably less during less-desirable times of the year (the times when people like me aren't trying to travel there). However, seeing as how the fine folks at Delta Airlines were practically begging me for my business, I could hardly refuse, and what's more, I am always amenable to supporting Atlanta institutions.

I booked the tickets and an AirBnb about a month in advance. It is probably a good idea to do this earlier, but then your back-and-forth may not be as reasoned as you might hope. The best deal I found on AirBnb was in the neighborhood of Vedado for $50 a night. Others can often be cheaper, but bear in mind two things; first, Cuba doesn't have ubiquitous internet like in the United States (more on that later), so it can be very hard for someone to put their house online, and second, every American and their mother wants to visit right now. Actually, bear in mind a third thing, which is that the government regulates pretty much everything, and bureaucracy can create a big swamp.

# Boarding the flight

Some phrases if you were just `ctrl+f` searching for the section that would tell you what you want to know: `passport, boarding, visa, reason, tourist, tourism, lazy, can i go to cuba for vacation legally`

So now, the important parts.

# Last day, getting to the Cuban airport

We left for the airport at 10:30 to catch an 2:30 flight, because we were worried lines would be really backed up or we might face other difficulties. They weren't at all, so we sat in the airport and read our respective books until it came time to board. The cab to the airport costed $25. In the airport lobby, there was a speaker whose sole purpose (it seemed) was to emit awful, high-pitched squeaks at odd intervals, effectively making it horribly uncomfortable to sit in most places. I have no idea why it was there. If anyone knows what the point of that speaker is, I would love to know. We got chicken and fries in the airport lobby for about $6 per plate (on the expensive side, but not a horrible way to spend money). The entire time we were eating we were interrupted by awful, high-pitched squeaks which no one else seemed to be able to hear. Before I located the device on the wall I thought it was an older person playing a practical joke with an iPhone app.

# Getting back through customs

It was surprisingly easy to get through customs, significantly faster (oddly) than returning from Canada. The agent asked a few questions, like, "were we traveling there for business or vacation," but being the quick-on-our-feet thinkers we are, we didn't fall for it and told him we were coming back from a people-to-people exchange. Otherwise, they didn't ask anything a normal customs officer wouldn't ask.
