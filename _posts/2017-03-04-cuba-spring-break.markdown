# Introduction

After I get back, I'll write this better.

# Why did this happen?

Back in January, I went to interview for a research lab in upstate New York (which is really, really cold). It was pretty cool, but the major outcome was that I ended up with an $800 travel voucher for Delta Airlines for taking a slightly later flight. I'd been thinking about going to Cuba since the embargo was (more or less) lifted, and it turned out that two flights between Atlanta and Havana on Delta costed almost exactly $800. It is cool to think about being able to go somewhere my that was closed off all through my parents' lifetime. It's probably a bit similar to if my kid were to go to North Korea, if North Korea were sunny and had nice beaches and rum.
