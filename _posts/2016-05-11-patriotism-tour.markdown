## Nashville

{% highlight poem %}
And lo, humble Nashville, with many a sound
Your Blues and your Gumbo were fine
And though there was rubble and butts all around
And tourists that came here to dine,
Your charm will be miss'd, and your spirit, which hit
Close to our hearts, you will find
Will not be forgotten (though chicken was rotten)
And will be at the back of our mind
We payed lots of cash at Museum Johnny Cash
And were lost like a book with no spine
But without a respite we're changing our site
Like a rabbit who forgot the time
And now we sit, our feet very sore
On the transport equivalent of one dollar stores
{% endhighlight %}

### Day 1: Bongo / Gumbo / Dunn Bro's

We left Atlanta at 6:00 am after an all-nighter of cleaning the apartment and packing. After 5 hours of sleep (and not 4, due to an unexpected change of timezone), we arrived in Nashville outside the state capitol building and were greeted with the sound of construction and the smell of non-electric cigarettes. We walked to the hostel, which someone else said looked sketchy from the outside but really wasn't, put our stuff in lockers, and went to walk around. We first stumbled into the Music City Center, which was having an expo for Car Washers, sponsored by the International Car Washing Association. It was like a comic convention but without costumes. We ended up getting lunch at Robert's Western World, notable for being in Aziz Ansari's Netflix show, "Master of None" (although unlike in the show, no one was dancing, but there were a few older folks listening to the live Elvis or Johnny Cash impersonator - not sure which one). We then walked around a bit, and ended up in the Johnny Cash museum Bongo Cafe, which was like every other coffee shop except Johnny Cash was everywhere. We then proceeded to take an elevator to an employees-only section and set off a fire alarm trying to get back to the main part.

After that, we went back to the hostel and I took a nap while Wei Wei called people and took care of stuff. I woke up and called my brother to wish him happy birthday. We then walked around a bunch. Nashville has a walking bridge across the Cumberland River which is really scenic; you can see the skyline, and it divides the tourist part from the heartland, so that Nashville's American values don't get too corrupted. Some students were filming a Flash remake, so one of them was running normally (Flash) while the other was running slowly. There was something to do with the Grammy organization (a country music show maybe) but we didn't go in. We then went to eat Gumbo and Catfish sliders at Bourbon Street Blues and Boogie Bar, where they had live Blues music. The Gumbo was delicious, and the Catfish bread was really good (Catfish itself wasn't too bad). I had the Big Easy IPA by Abita Brewing (out of Lousiana), which Wei Wei and I both liked, although it probably was too easy to drink for people on Beer Advocate to appreciate. After that we walked around some more and ended up skipping rocks and waving to people on a ship that kept going by, the General Jackson South-will-rise-again cruise ship. We were pretty tired from not having slept the night before, so we didn't go to the Burlesque show. We tried watching an episode of Evangelion but apparently I downloaded the version without any English translation, and although Wei Wei could translate parts (very surprising) it wasn't worth it and we just went to bed.

Oh yeah, Dunn Bro's was another coffee place we walked by. It wasn't notable except for the way it sounds like Bongo and Gumbo.

### Day 2: Nashville, a Bastion of Roman Intellectualism

After being pretty lame last night and going to bed at 10:00, I woke up at 7:30 am to some of the people sharing our hostel room packing up and leaving. There is a pretty big nightly turnover, it seems like most people just stay for a night or two. I didn't get to speak much to the people who were here before, but today two new people came, they were from Britain and apparently wanted to see some of the non-tourist destinations in the United States (they just came from Chicago). I realized they were from not-the-US because they used an adapter to plug their phones in. I told the guy all I know about Britain is that Leicester just won the Premier Leagueo and he gave me a feel like he's heard that a lot lately.

![Church street and Gay street](/resources/us_roadtrip/nashville/church_gay.jpg)

Once Wei Wei and I were completely out of bed around 9:00, we went for a walk-run around a part of Nashville that we didn't walk around yesterday. It turns out that the parts we walked around yesterday pretty much covered the interesting bits of the tourist locations, because everything on the other side of the river was pretty much an average suburban neighborhood. My personal impression yesterday was that people are really nice here, but I think that might just be people who are trying to sell me something. The bus drivers are really nice, though, except the one who didn't stop for us (although he probably just didn't see us).

![Music City Center](/resources/us_roadtrip/nashville/music_city_center.jpg)

After walk-running, we went to a convenience store and got some oatmeal, bananas and orange juice, which we had for breakfast. The hostel kitchen is on point. They have some pretty cool electric stoves and an elaborate washing station, plus free seasonings for people to use. After making and eating breakfast, including spilling some tea on the ground and smearing it around, we somehow ended up at the Parthenon, despite getting really confused. The Nashville city planners need to change the name of either the "Music City Center" or the "Music City Central" because one is a bus station and one is an expo center, and the people at the information desk in the expo center had no idea how to get on the number 10.

![Athena](/resources/us_roadtrip/nashville/athena.jpg)

Once we actually got on a bus, we got cultured at the Parthenon, which is the only full-scale replica of the original Roman Parthenon outside of the Roman Parthenon, unless North Korea has one they haven't told anyone about. It was built for the Nashville Centennial celebration, which took place 101 years after the city's founding, and it was originally supposed to be torn down after 6 months, but almost a hundred years on it is still here. Wei Wei wanted to go there because of the Percy Jackson series. Some people who were throwing a frisbee outside it let us pet their dog and gave us some pointers on where to go next. Apparently Electric Avenue and Jimmy Kelly's steak house are good places to go.

![Parthenon](/resources/us_roadtrip/nashville/parthenon.jpg)

Inside the Parthenon was a huge replica of the Athena Parthenos. There was also an art exhibit of paintings inspired by Grimm's fairy tales. After the Parthenon we walked around Centennial Park, where they had a pedal-swing, a real quality piece of engineering. Then we walked over to Vanderbilt to see the Student Life Center and some other stuff. We picked up some stuff up from Kroger's to make [mom's spaghetti](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW-BU6keEUw) tomorrow for lunch, and came back and got dinner at B.B. King's, which had some really good Blue's music. The drumming was like it was from Whiplash. The guitarist was Grammy-nominated, too. We found a small liquor store and got what we thought were local Nashville beers, Yazoo Hefeweisen's, but apparently they're not local enough for the guy who ran the liquor store. In his words, "Yazoo has gotten too big for it's britches" and "all their beers taste the same," which means they're not underground enough for him anymore. He recommended Wiseacre, which is a brewery in Memphis. Then he sold us the 6-pack of Hefeweisen for $14. We drank them and talked to some Swedish people who were playing folk songs in the lobby area. They were part of a band called Angry Train Wreck.

### Day 3: Old Bar, New Fetish

We decided to make today a chill day, partially because I had some work to get done and partially because we'd been walking around a lot the last two days. A new guy from last night snored a lot, but Wei Wei had the foresight to get earplugs, which was a lifesaver. He and his girlfriend left this morning and were replaced by a French psychologist and a group of college-age students from Baltimore. The English couple is still here, but we didn't see much of them today.

![Horse statue](/resources/us_roadtrip/nashville/horse.jpg)

There was rain and lightning around midday, which meant it was a good time for us to stay inside. We made oatmeal, bananas, and eggs for breakfast, along with some coffee to help pass along all the fried food we've been eating. I worked a bit on making a website for Emory Arts Underground, as well as some other stuff. For lunch we made spaghetti and meatballs, and had some more of the way-too-mainstream Hefeweisen's. Wei Wei went for a walk while I did some more work, and reported a large number of people on Broadway Avenue (by the way, south of Broadway here is called SoBro). We walked over there, but pretty much everywhere was 21-plus (I wasn't about to leave Wei Wei out on the street).

![Pedal tavern](/resources/us_roadtrip/nashville/pedal_tavern.jpg)

We ended up at a 3-story restaurant called Crazy Town, which had just opened apparently. They had a different band playing on every floor. We ordered "spicy chicken," which was the laziest way to cook chicken possible. It was literally a chicken that someone had deep-fried whole and put on some French Fries. It was really greasy and made us both feel very heavy. We also danced to the music (at Wei Wei's request) and the band played some weird rap-country mixup which ended with "2 CHAINZ".

![Chicken](/resources/us_roadtrip/nashville/chicken.jpg)

In the bathroom of the restaurant there was a young man turning the sink faucet on and off and spraying peoples' hands with soap, which I thought was pretty cool until he made it clear it wasn't a free service. On the plus side I got some gum out of it. Wei Wei said the women's bathroom also had someone doing it, but they weren't soliciting money. We walked over to the hockey stadium after that, Nissan Stadium, home of the Nashville Predators. The Nashville Predators got shat on by the San Jose Sharks, 5-0. It was pretty neat because it was an away game, so they opened up the stadium to everyone and streamed the game on the big screens inside the rink. By the time we got there they were already down 4-0, so there were a lot of people leaving. The goalie broke his stick on the goal.

![Blues](/resources/us_roadtrip/nashville/blues.jpg)

By that time it was around 10:30, and we wanted to get over to see the Burlesque Show at the Skull's Rainbow Room. Apparently the bar has been around since the 1930's, since the prohibition era. The performer was Midnite Martini. We both sat at the bar, and the guy next to me recommended a cranberry sour, which was really good, even if it was 8 dollars. There was a woman named Jennifer who bought 73 dollars worth of alcohol and paid a 20 dollar tip, along with a 20 dollar tip for the burlesque dancer, and told the two men who were hitting on her that I was her son. She was a burlesque dancer at one point, apparently. No bones about it, burlesque is hot. I didn't know taking off clothes could be so artistic. But damn.

### Day 4: Music my Mom Listens To

Today was our last full day in Nashville. Tomorrow our bus leaves at 10:00 am, so we're just going to get up, make breakfast and leave. We made oatmeal and fruit for breakfast again, and decided to go see the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum, which turned out to be an entire building dedicated to playing songs my parents sang when I was a kid. There were some really cool guitar collections, and a whole exhibit dedicated to Sam Phillips, the producer for Howlin' Wolf, Carl Perkins, Jerry Lee Lewis, Johnny Cash and Elvis. There was also a lot of Taylor Swift stuff. Wei Wei and I did the kids' activity and sent the result to Juan's email. We wandered around the hotel next to the museum for a bit.

![Words](/resources/us_roadtrip/nashville/words.jpg)

We came back and made spaghetti for lunch again. We did some work for a bit and around 8:00 we went to the Bourbon Street Blues and Boogie Bar again, because there was a pretty good singer there. We got some more Gumbo and danced to the music. Wei Wei is a good dancer, she doesn't have inhibitions, or at least doesn't show them very much. We were the youngest people there by a decent amount, although there were some 30-year-old-looking men who were dancing near us. Mostly I thought my mom would have really liked it.

![Vanderbilt](/resources/us_roadtrip/nashville/vanderbilt.jpg)

We got back to the hostel and boiled the rest of our eggs so we can take them with us tomorrow. Wei Wei is actually pretty decent at foosball. I worked some more after she went to sleep. As I'm writing this, it's almost 3 am, but I got to a good stopping point with what I had to do. I'll sleep on the bus tomorrow. The bridges over the Cumberland River are lit up with colors every night, and I can see them from my bed, where I'm writing this.
