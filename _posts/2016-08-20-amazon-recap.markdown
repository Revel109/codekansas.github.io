  Recap of my internship at Amazon during the summer of 2016.
---

All the opinions I express in this post are strictly my own.

**TL;DNR** Amazon is a good place to go if you want to do things well and be pushed to do them better.

# My project

I worked on the Amazon India team. Over the course of the internship, I built several APIs to integrate with India's invoice management service, which my team owns. I also built a web service for interacting with each of the APIs. My project was closely tied to another intern's project, so we both got very familiar with using Git to work simultaneously on the same code base. Additionally, near the end of the internship I was pretty much done with my project, and I got to diagnose and solve a Sev 2 issue.

My knee-jerk reaction to building APIs and a website is, "this seems pretty plain vanilla, I wouldn't want to do that". However, there was a lot of nuance and complexity that made it challenging and engaging, and once I was done I could clearly see the impact it would have. I was very pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed working on it and the level of ownership I felt. I was also really impressed that they would give an intern the responsibility to handle a high severity issue.

# Crying at work

Based on [a certain New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html), I thought Amazon was going to be high-stress, high-demand on a constant basis. That definitely wasn't my experience. Most people I asked about the article also said it didn't reflect their experience. However, it isn't taken for granted that you're good at your job. As another SDE said, Amazon tends to end up with people who have high expectations already, so while I never saw anyone cry at work, I would imagine it would be more from internal pressure than external. It felt what I'd imagine a startup feels like.

Additionally, I should say how awesome my team was. Everyone was extremely competent. There was ample support if I got stuck. I never felt overworked or underworked. Ping Pong was very popular in our office.

# Interview process

I don't want to (and probably can't) talk about specific interview questions, but I will give some of my personal background and prep work. I spent a lot of time making Flash games in middle school, but did practically no coding throughout high school, and only started in force once I got to college. When I started applying, I had taken about two and a half years of computer science classes. Other people have written about what makes people good or bad at computer science, but in my opinion, the most important things are to be okay with failing and to be willing to put in enough effort. A strong math background also doesn't hurt (many interviews I did seemed to test my ability to think mathematically). And you should be able to sit and work on one thing for about an hour at a time without getting distracted.

I didn't prepare much for interviews, but I did study for the ACM and I like to compete in online coding competitions (the Google Code Jam and Facebook Hacker's Cup are good practice, besides being things you can put on your resume). An algorithms class is usually necessary. If you have never looked at [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/098478280X) I would really, really recommend getting a copy, or getting with a friend who has a copy. You should be able to figure out the best answers to the Hard problems with some assistance. There are some questions which have interesting tricks.

Lastly, even if you don't go to a big Tech school, it is totally possible to land a decent internship, although the lack of name recognition may hurt. I go to Emory University in Atlanta, and our computer science program is dwarfed by Georgia Tech. If you're in a similar position, I found that reaching out to people directly really helped. Use your school's Alumni network and send personal emails to recruiters.

 / /___/ / __/  __/  / __  / /_/ / /__/ ,<   
/_____/_/_/  \___/  /_/ /_/\__,_/\___/_/|_|  

If, like my case, your school isn't frequented by tech recruiters, here is a life hack: Put on LinkedIn that you're a computer science major graduating this year, and you will probably get a lot more emails from recruiters who are just spamming LinkedIn's search tools. Then, when they email you about applying for a job, ask them to put you in contact with an intern hiring manager. Just kidding. Maybe.

Amazon's interviews were speedy, probably the shortest start-to-offer time of any company I applied for. You can probably check Glassdoor for non-anecdotal evidence, but most people I asked had similar experiences. For me it was about two weeks. I didn't think the interview went super well, but I solved the problem they presented me. Some other interns I talked to didn't even have coding interviews.

# Non-compete agreement

An annoying thing about Amazon (and many tech companies, although I've heard it's more strict at Amazon) is that you have to [sign an NDA and non-compete agreement](https://www.quora.com/Why-does-Amazon-require-an-NDA-in-order-to-interview-with-their-company) while working there. Part of the contract means that if you want to work on outside projects of any kind (for me, contributing to open-source projects on Github or working on my Master's thesis) you have to get it cleared with Human Resources. This is so that you don't accidentally work on something that another part of Amazon is working on. This might be standard practice for many companies, but it felt weird when I started.

# Internal projects

Amazon has some [really cool internal projects](http://www.techinsider.io/amazon-secret-projects-2015-8), but there is a decent amount of secrecy even within the company. But for people concerned that Amazon isn't leading innovation in certain areas, they are certainly bulking up their research. I got to go to the [DSSTNE](https://github.com/amznlabs/amazon-dsstne) release talk, which was really cool. Overall, the vibe I got from the Personalization team (which does a lot of the Machine Learning work) was very pragmatic. For example, DSSTNE was made to emphasize support for only vanilla neural network architectures, but with sparse matrices (all of this is public knowledge; you can infer what this might mean for how they do product recommendations).

# Return offer

I believe the standard offer for college graduates is $100,000 per year, with a signing bonus and stock options. You have to be around for a year to actually keep the signing bonus and stocks, though. Seattle is more affordable than San Francisco, although less affordable than other places. I spent about $600 a month on housing while I was here, due to being a college student who lived with other college students, but it would be reasonable to expect to spend $1000 to $2000 a month on rent, depending on stinginess. Additionally, you can also choose which team you want to join after you return (unlike Microsoft, apparently).
