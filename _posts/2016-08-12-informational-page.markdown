# PyData Carolinas 2016

I gave a tutorial about using Keras for language modeling, basically about a
blog post I wrote. It is available on YouTube
[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvZnphPgz74).

# ISCAS 2016

When I went to ISCAS in Montreal (I wrote a blog post about it [here](http://127.0.0.1:4000/blog/2016/patriotism-tour.html#montreal))

# Neural network implementations

I've written a few neural network implementations (mostly for learning about them)

 - [tinier-nn](https://github.com/codekansas/tinier-nn) (I abandoned this when I realized my matrix libraries would never be good enough)
 - [JNeuralNetworks](https://github.com/codekansas/JNeuralNetwork)
 - [CNeuralNetworks](https://github.com/codekansas/CNeuralNetworks)
 - [matlab_neural_networks](https://github.com/codekansas/matlab_neural_networks)
