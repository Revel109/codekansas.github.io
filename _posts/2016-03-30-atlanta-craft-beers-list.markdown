These are some facts and opinions regarding craft beers that can be bought at the Krogers near my apartment.

SweetWater IPA
---------------

**Brewed by** SweetWater Brewing Company, Georgia, United States

**Style** 'Merican IPA

**ABV** 6.3%

SweetWater is about as big an Atlanta institution as Coca Cola or The Varsity. Pretty good, really hopsy. They served it at the PyData meetup at MailChip, along with non-chain store pizza.

Sand Island Lighthouse
----------------------

**Brewed by** Straight to Ale, Alabama, United States

**Style** Kolsch (clear, with a bright yellow hue, warm fermented and conditioned by lagering, which means it was matured in cold storage; usually ABV of 4.4% to 5.2%, medium bitterness of 20 to 30 IBU)

**ABV** 5.1%

It goes down pretty easily. It seems kind of nutty. Not something I would drink to get drunk, but good for drinking while doing work or hanging out. A lot of people on beeradvocate.com think it is fruity. It comes in a can, although I don't think it had the nitrogren thing on the lid, so it is either too mainstream or way, way underground. The can itself has some cool art on it, but not in-your-face avant garde art. The brewer, "Straight to Ale", might be a pun, but if it is, I don't get it. It tastes pretty good, though. All around: 4 plaid shirts.

Pabst Blue Ribbon
-----------------

**Brewed by** Pabst Brewing Company, California, United States

**Style** American Adjunct Lager (light bodied, pale, fizzy, less bitter with moderate (4.0% to 6.0%) alcohol, focus less on flavor and more on mass production; probably the beer your dad drinks)

**ABV** 4.74%

As with anyone who likes craft beers, PBR is my go-to beverage of choice. Ironically, I don't drink it ironically, but because at 67 cents a can (in 2016 adjusted dollars) it is the cheapest one at Krogers that doesn't advertise during the Super Bowl. Probably best if you want to get drunk, but don't want to be associated with people who get drunk. All around: 3 ironic glasses.
