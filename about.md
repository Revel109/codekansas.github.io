Hello! You've reached my homepage. I am a Master's student in Computer Science at Emory University, advised by [Avani Wildani](http://mathcs.emory.edu/~avani). I'm interested in machine learning, traveling, and watching cooking vlogs. I've interned at Amazon (building infrastructure for India) and Google (improving handwriting recognition) and will be at Facebook in Seattle this summer.

I split this blog between machine learning posts (relating to whatever I happen to be working on) and personal posts (which are about a number of things, mostly traveling). The RSS feed at the bottom only has machine learning posts, though.
